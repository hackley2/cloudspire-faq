## I received the update pack and noticed some of the hexes on my islands are forests but the scenario book says they are plains, which is correct?

Those hexes are plains. The neoprene isles numbers 7 and 8 in the second printing of cloudspire have
some small graphical changes to help with clarity. These hexes were always meant to be plains hexes
and the graphics were changed to make that distinction more clear

## What components are considered limited?

Attack, range, and fortification upgrade chips are considered limited.

Health chips, advancement pegs, and attack dice are all unlimited. In the rare case you run out, use
a suitable replacement.

If a component has a discard, like market chips, relics, or earthscapes, and you run out of these
components, reshuffle the discard to create a new supply
