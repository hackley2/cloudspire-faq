# Neglected Talent

Both talents should say “are the only faction minion type in play,” as neutral revealed landmark
minions do not prevent these talents from triggering

# Can I construct a Drilling Outpost spire during the onslaught phase with a spire reward from a landmark?

No. The Drilling Outpost spire’s “Mining” talent prevents the spire from being constructed at any
time that isn’t the build phase, which includes through the use of a spire reward

# What happens if the Forsaken minion rolls a [No Move] while on the top of the deployment stack with other units behind it?

Units in the deployment stack are inactive, so all of their talents are ignored until they deploy.
Units that roll dice before movement, like the forsaken, will not roll their dice on the turn they
are deployed because their talent is inactive at the point it would normally trigger. After a unit
is deployed it will roll the die as normal

# What does ‘permanently promoted’ mean on brawnen advancements?

When the brawnen purchase an advancement that says “____ minions are permanently promoted”, all
minions of the promoted type in play and in the barracks are flipped to their promoted side. For the
rest of the game the affected minions cannot be selected for deployment on their basic side, but if
a game effect would put them back onto their basic side, like the architect’s builder talent, the
effect still resolves normally

# Can I use Raze from a Siege Tower I just constructed using a limited build option?

Yes! Both limited build options and the Raze ability happen during the Start of Turn step of a
player’s turn, and because it is still during the start of turn when the spire is constructed the
talent is still in the correct timing window to be used!

# If a Siege Tower uses Raze against a fortress gate and does no damage, does it still lose an upgrade?

Yes. The Siege tower is still considered to have attacked the fortress gate even if the resulting
damage is 0. Note, that the fortress gate only retaliates when units attack
it (Rules Reference Page 16), so the fortress gate does not retaliate against Siege Tower spires
using the Raze talent

# Are Siege Towers still allowed to attack like normal spires when they use Raze?

Yep! Spires may only attack once per turn, and since Raze happens during the brawnen’s turn it does
not impact the spires ability to attack during opponent’s turns during the spires fire step

# Can a forsaken that rolled “No attack” on its die still retaliate when attacked?

Yep. Retaliation is not an attack so a Forsaken may retaliate as normal. Additionally, the forsaken
die only applies its effect during the brawnen’s turn, so the “No Attack” result would have no
effect anyway
