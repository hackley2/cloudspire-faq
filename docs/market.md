# Do heroes equipped with Makeshift Wings gain the ability to move on any terrain?

No. The flying talent does not change the unit's terrain allowance. A hero with a forest terrain
allowance and Makeshift Wings is still restricted to forest terrain and below. That hero may not
move on mountain and water hexes

# When a unit activates Time Vials’ back to the future talent, will enemy spires in range attack after the movement?

Nope! Back to the future grants a move and an attack, which happen during the end of the turn. No
other steps of the turn are repeated. It is still part of the same turn so units that retaliated
this turn will not be able to retaliate again

# Can I save my purchased market chip for future waves or do I have to use it on the same wave I got it?

You are not obligated to use any market purchase on the same wave you acquire it

# Does Londil’s talent leech happen before or after the retaliation?

Londill will always trigger leech and heal, after retaliation, as the attacker or retaliator.

Page 2 of the rules reference under “Attack” explains that an ability that triggers ‘after
attacking’ does so after retaliation because retaliation is considered to be part of the attack

# What is the purpose of having the talent 1 Range on a unit if units can already attack adjacently?

The merc hero Yewsel and the equipment Slingshot both have the talent 1 range. Heroes with the range
talent are allowed to gain range upgrades when leveling up, unlike most other heroes

# Is the Tracker talent missing from the landmarks reference sheet?

The # Tracker talent can be found in the # section of the reference.\
