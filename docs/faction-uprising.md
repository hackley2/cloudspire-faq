# Uprising Netorut Lookout # talent

Netorut’s lookout talent should say “within # of hexes of this unit or spire”

# Do merc units purchased by the uprising return to their barracks when they are defeated?

No. Mercs controlled by the uprising are still merc units and follow all the normal rules for merc
units, including being added to the market discard when defeated (or removed from the game if
heroes)

# Is the Uprising’s Draft phase affected by other factions' gateport advancements?

No. The draft market is not the same as the market phase, so any game effect that happens during the
market phase will not apply during the draft market phase

# Does Unstable on Uprising Waygates defeat groups of units like Unstable Rift?

No. Unstable specifically defeats active units. Units in a group are not active and therefore cannot
be defeated by Unstable. When this ability is used with adjacent groups only the topmost minion is
defeated in the stack

# Can I build a Waygate on the separate island made in the Portal Seekers Anomaly game mode?

No. Build Waygate only allows the uprising to build a Waygate in a place that is connected by path.
Although the riftwalk talent allows units to move on and off the island, it is only treated as a
path hex for unit movement. When considering connection to the mark, the riftwalk talent is not
considered

# Does Netorut lose the difference in health when he uses the Build Waygate talent and flips to his basic side?

Nope! While heroes do gain the difference in their health when they promote, they do not lose health
when going back

# Do uprising units retaliate when attacked by friendly units?

Yes! A unit will attack the first time it is attacked each turn

# Do uprising heroes level up when defeating their own units?

Yes

# When using infiltration ops in a 3 or 4 player game, do you have to apply the effect to the player you infiltrated or can you choose any player?

Yes! You can choose any fortress structure from any player

# Does Netorut deal 2 damage to landmarks when he gains Hunter through the Theive’s Den - Hunting contract advancement?

No. Netorut, and any other unit that has hunter naturally like the Mountaineer, will not benefit
from this advancement. Redundant skills do not stack together.

If Netorut is promoted, his promoted side will gain hunter as normal
