# Can units move on or through Tunnel Access chips placed by Greige units?

No. In order for a unit to move onto a hex, the hex must be unoccupied in order to be considered a
valid hex. The hex is occupied by the chip so units cannot move on or through it, including griege
units, unless another ability says otherwise, like the Greige fortress advancement Tunnel System 3 -
Shortcut

# Can I use burrow or dig on Source wells?

No. Source wells are not considered non-path hexes and cannot be used for these talents

# If I have a Broodnest spire and the only adjacent path hex is invalid, do I still spawn a larva minion at the start of my first turn?

Yes. When a larva minion spawns on an invalid hex it follows the rules for invalid hexes on page 10
of the rules reference

# Do the Griege get the rewards for units defeated by toxic secretion or toxic fumes?

Yep! When a unit is defeated by a Greige controlled Toxic Secretion talent or by a toxic fumes chip,
the Greige are responsible for the defeat and get the rewards for it. Toxic Secretion from landmark
minions do not count as Griege defeats, as landmarks are not Greige units.

If a defeat from toxic secretion occurs from Echri’s Toxic Secretion she gained from the Queen’s
Chamber fortress advancement, Echri levels up.

In the rare instance where there are multiple different Toxic Secretion talents, and which one
caused the defeat matters (for example a unit moves adjacent to both a Gekweb and a Throaxx landmark
minion at the same time) the player whose turn it is decides the order in which the damage is
applied

# Do you have to choose a Greige minion type when using splice, or can you choose any minion type?

You do not. The minion type can be any minion in the game including allies and opposing minions

# When using the Surrogate Chamber, does excess damage carry over to the Greige fortress and do players get rewards for defeating the defending unit?

Excess damage is not carried over and the attacking player does gain rewards, including both source
and leveling up if the attacking unit is a hero. The fortress gate will retaliate even when the
defending unit is defeated

# If I roll the Evo die and I do not have any more of the rolled unit in my barracks, what happens?

The larva simply promotes to its promoted side. The use of the die is optional, so after seeing the
rolled result if that unit is unavailable your only choice is to forgo the benefit.

# Can a burrower still evolve like other Greige minions or does it have to use its burrow talent?

The borrower may still evolve as normal. Do note that doing so means that it can be attacked by
opposing heroes, unlike when using the burrow talent where it cannot be attacked at all.

# Will an evolving minion retaliate if it is attacked by a hero and not defeated?

Yes. Inactive units retaliate like other units. Evolving minions are still on their basic side so
they retaliate using the stats from their basic side.

# Are units in the evo chamber considered “in play”?

??? (Yes?)

# If my heroes return to the fortress using the Tunnel System - Shortcut and my opponents heroes go into campfire mode as a result, when I redeploy my heroes do my opponents heroes stay in campfire mode?

Yes. Campfire mode lasts for the entire wave, regardless of how it is triggered

# When deploying using the Tunnel System - Workers Way, where do I measure if I made progress from?

Your units still form a deployment stack on your fortress gate, as normal. When they move off the
fortress gate they may do so adjacent to one of the Tunnel Access chips in play. The amount of
progress they made uses the fortress gate hex as the hex they started from

# If I have the Evo Purifier advancement, do I gain source for all evolutions my faction makes or only evolutions from the Evo Accelerator?

Evo purifier grants source for all successful evolutions

# Do units in the Evo pit start with a health, and therefore have 2 health chips at the start of the grieges first turn?

Yep! Using the evo pit is an expedited way of evolving Greige minions
