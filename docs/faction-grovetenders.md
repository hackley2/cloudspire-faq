# Is Ybanthe allowed to use Evoke to summon a unit on a non-adjacent path hex?

Yes. The evoke talent specifies that the unit is summoned on the path hex closest to Ybanthe, which
does not necessarily have to be adjacent or valid. If the hex is invalid (for example, the path
being summoned on has no connection to the grovetender’s mark), the summoned minion will follow the
rules for invalid hexes found on page 10 of the rules reference.

Note: This is different from a Muskeg spire, which specifically calls out valid hex in the text for
Wallop

# What non-merc sources can defeat a unit with the talent Peaceful?

Peaceful only prevents the unit from being damaged. An effect that defeats it outright, like
Unstable (uprising), Unstable Rift (landmark), Consume (griege) will not be prevented by peaceful.

Other abilities that do not do damage will also still affect Wyvankaye, like the Fortress Portal
relic.

Note: Equipment they give their abilities to the unit they are equipped to. So Magic Like Missiles
from the Staff of Anvasse, which does damage, is coming from the unit it is equipped to and
therefore will only damage a unit with the peaceful talent if the unit that it is equipped to is a
merc unit

# Can units that were summoned through the summon or evoke talent attack on the turn they were summoned?

Absolutely! These talents only prevent a summoned unit from moving on the turn it was summoned.
Attacking, exploring, and using talents may all be done without penalty

# Can Dywen use Pacify on a unit with Engage?

No. Engage says that units that are able to attack must do so. For Dywen, because she can attack the
unit with engage, she cannot use her Pacify talent because she does not have the option to forgo her
attack

# Can you have more than one unit from basic form on the same hero?

Yes! If you place 2 units under the same hero over the course of multiple waves it will have the
talents of all units under it. However, redundant talents do not stack, so a hero with 2 Warbriars
under it will still only do 1 damage from impale

# Does the Orgegrowth’s Challenge talent prevent opposing units within its effect range from using ‘instead of attacking’ talents like weak-point from the hammer and chisel equipment?

Challenge says that any attack a hero makes must be against this unit. Weak point is, itself, not an
attack, but it is ‘instead of attacking’. As a result, because the hero loses its ability to attack
it cannot use a ‘instead of attacking’ talent, unless that talent was directed at the Orgegrowth
because the hero can attack it

# Can creeping vines spires use their creep talent to move onto Source wells?

No. Source wells are not considered non-path hexes and cannot be used for the creep talent
