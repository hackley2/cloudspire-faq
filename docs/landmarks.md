# Why do landmark minions have movement stats?

Some talents or game effects, like the relic Edible Bribery or the Greige minion Mugwump with its
recruiter talent allows a player to gain control of landmark minions. Landmark minions otherwise do
not move on their own

# Can spires attack landmark minions?

No. Spires fire during the ‘spires fire’ step of a player's turn, targeting the active players
units. A landmark minion is not under the control of any player so spires will never attack them.

If a landmark minion is under the control of a player, it can be attacked by a player's spires
because it is controlled by the active player when the spire attacks.

# Does teleporting using a gateport landmark’s riftwalk talent cost any movement?

No. When a unit teleports, that unit does not use any amount of movement to do so and continues its
movement from the point it was before the teleport

# Are gateport landmarks considered path hexes for the purposes of connection to possible marks?

No. The riftwalk talent allows units to move onto it as though it were a path hex, but it is not
actually a path hex. All possible marks must always be connected by path terrain, so any adjustment
to the play area or relocation of a possible mark (such as with Horizon’s Wrath’s fortress or
Uprising’s Build waygate talent) that would require the use of a riftwalk to access the mark is not
allowed

# How much source do I gain when I reveal the Naroran Altar landmark?

When you reveal the Naroran Altar you gain 1 source for each health chip on active units adjacent to
it, regardless of who controls those units. Inactive units in a group do not have health, so you do
not gain any source from those units when grouped.

The landmark is responsible for the defeat, not the player, so source rewards for units defeated
this way are not gained by the revealing player

# When I use the Vision Stone landmark to reveal all other landmarks and the Naroran Rift landmark is revealed, do I get the source from defeating their units?

No. When you reveal the landmark, the vision stone reveals all other landmarks. You do not gain any
benefits from revealing it because it was not you who revealed it

# Do I get to level up with a hero that removes the last health off the Altar of Aggression?

No. Landmarks with health stats that are not units, like the altar of aggression, do not get
defeated. They are discarded when their health is removed. Heroes only level up on a defeat, so a
hero would not level up for removing the health from this landmark

# If a landmark minion with a spire reward is not on a Source well, perhaps because a player took control of it, can I construct a spire for free when I defeat it?

No. When a unit with a spire reward is defeated it only grants a spire reward on the hex it was
defeated on and only if it is a Source well
